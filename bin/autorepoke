Autorepoke just repokes people that are on a whitelist after they have poked you.  Really not much to it.  Use at your own risk!

Usage:
  autorepoke [options]

Where options are:
EOS

  opt :username, "Facebook username", :type => :string
  opt :password, "Facebook password", :type => :string
  opt :ids, "Comma Separated list of numeric Facebook ids to poke back", :type => :string
end

unless opts.ids
  puts "ids required"
  exit
end

username = opts.username
password = opts.password
ids = opts.ids.split(",")

unless password
  print "Facebook password: "
  password = STDIN.noecho(&:gets)
  print "\n"
end
